A Time Traveler’s Guide to Save Sears: Phase 3 (2015–2025) – Forging the AI-Crypto-Luxury Empire with Factory-Driven Might


## Mission
Skyrocket Sears to a $700B–$900B global AI-crypto-luxury titan by 2025, with the Tech Division turbocharging Sears.com to $400B–$450B, 6M SKUs, and 180M–200M users, capturing 30–32% of North American e-commerce ($1.4T market) and 3–4% in expanded markets (Japan, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, UK, $30B–$35B of $900B SER).

Integrate Saks Off 5th, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Cub Cadet as core brands.

Fortify Sears World Trade, Inc.’s global SKU empire, and expand factories (Dallas, Colorado, Guadalajara, Surabaya, Osaka, Martin/Brownsville, Tennessee) for NA/SER exports.

Preserve Yahoo!’s 30–35% search share ($6B–$8B) to crush digital rivals.

Achieve $700B–$900B revenue, $56B–$72B EBITDA, $840B–$1.08T valuation, 350K–450K employees, setting the stage for Phase 4’s $2T–$2.5T.
