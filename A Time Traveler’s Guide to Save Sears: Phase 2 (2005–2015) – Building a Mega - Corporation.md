A Time Traveler’s Guide to Save Sears: Phase 2 (2005–2015) – Building a Mega - Corporation

## Mission
Catapult Sears into a $200B–$250B AI-driven retail-tech-luxury juggernaut by 2015, with the Tech Division propelling Sears.com to $80B–$90B, 3.5M SKUs, and 80M–85M users, seizing 8–9% of the North American e-commerce market (~$1T) and 1.5% in expanded markets (Japan, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, UK, $4.5B of $300B SER).

Revive Sears World Trade, Inc. to fuel Sears.com’s global SKU dominance.

Integrate Yahoo! (30–35% search share, $4B–$5B), launch SearsCoin and Consumer Data Marketplace (CDM).

Build factories for NA/SER exports.

Achieve $16B–$20B EBITDA, $240B–$300B valuation, and 200K–250K employees, setting up Phase 3’s $400B–$450B.
