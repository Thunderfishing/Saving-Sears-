### Why This Works

**Traditional Corporate "Charity":**
- One-time donations to existing nonprofits
- Minimal tax benefit
- Weak customer connection
- No competitive moat

**Datsun Opportunity Fund:**
- Purpose-built 501(c)(3) maximizing tax efficiency
- Directly serves Sears' customer base (working families)
- Creates fanatically loyal advocates (rescued from crisis)
- Regulatory/competitive armor (unique in automotive industry)
- Counter-cyclical (strengthens during recessions when need is highest)
- Authentic "stand-up corp" reputation (not PR spin)

**This is corporate charity as strategic infrastructure, not philanthropy.**
