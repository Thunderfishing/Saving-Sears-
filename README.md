### Funding
- **Total Funding**: $12B

### Financial Outcomes

### Acquisition Math Verification/Adjustment
To acquire 51% of Sears ($7B market cap = ~$3.57B needed):
- Short Black Monday (Oct 19, 1987): $300M capital at 20x leverage = $6B position. Sears stock dropped ~25% (from ~$60 to $45). Profit = $6B * 0.50 = $3B.
